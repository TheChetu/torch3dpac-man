Model description       : (old description) Here it is, my first finished original ppm for quake 
			  2.  The model is the main character in Final Fantasy 7, an RPG for the 
			  PSX, and just released for the PC.  I figured that I love the game so 
			  much that I might as well play as Cloud in Quake 2.  For some of the 
			  animations I tried to mimic actual animations from FF7.  It turned out 
			  pretty well.  Cloud does not have a gun, he carries a big-ass sword.  
			  If you have a problem with that, then you shouldn't have downloaded the
			  model :P  Feel free to make, or improve, skins for it.  If you do, be 
			  sure to send it to me so's that I might be able to use it.  No one may 
			  use this model in any mod (privite or commercial) without the 
			  permission of myself (please).  If you are intrested in using it for 
			  that purpose, feel free to mail me about it.

Other info              : Ok. My first Cloud version wasn't what it should have been.  3 days ago
			  I started to revise it.  I made another base skin, 256x256 (hell yeah),
   			  and 3 new skins: 1 normal and 3 ctf.  (what? 1+3 is 4 mark!  I know, 
			  but remember, Cloud's regular suit is blue and I used that.) Sorry to 
			  all (all? there were like, 2 :) those ppl trying to make new skins for 
			  the old baseframe.  I would think that to be extremely hard, so make 
			  skins for this one instead.  I also re-animated the stand animation 
			  (he was bouncing all over the place) and I animated a new flip 
			  animation. (his sword spins 360* but his hand/arm does not :)  Finally:
			  YES, the sword is still the same size, so boo.  I wanted to add View 
			  Wep support and have the different weapons from FF7, but i ran into 
			  some difficulties.  If anyone wants to help, or do this for me, feel 
			  free to e-mail me.
